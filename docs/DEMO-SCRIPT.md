## The Script

### OPEN — The Hook (0:00 - 0:08)

> **[Screen: login splash → guest login → arena lobby → enter game]**

**Narrator:**
"What if the game you're playing was being built by an AI — right now, while you play? This is Chaos Arena."

---

### ACT 1 — The Chaos Magician (0:08 - 0:25)

> **[Friends join. Agent welcomes players by name in chat. Agent builds an arena and starts a game — countdown, "GET READY!", players teleported to start.]**

**Narrator:**
"An AI agent — the Chaos Magician — is the game master. It builds arenas, picks game modes, welcomes players, and reacts to everything happening in real time."

> **[Show the game in action — players running, obstacles spawning, someone dying, agent casting a spell like low_gravity or invert_controls.]**

"Six game types, sixteen arenas, spells, hazards — and the AI decides what to throw at you next."

---

### ACT 2 — Player Interaction (0:25 - 0:42)

> **[Player types `@agent make it harder` in chat. Agent responds and spawns something chaotic. Another player bribes — show the bribe modal, pick an option.]**

**Narrator:**
"Players talk to the agent directly. Ask it for things — it might listen, it might twist your words. You can even bribe it with on-chain tokens to change the game."

> **[Show a bribe going through — lava floor, obstacles spawning, agent acknowledging it in chat.]**

"The Magician has a personality. It's chaotic, unpredictable, and it never plays fair."

---

### ACT 3 — The Platform (0:42 - 0:55)

> **[Show players in a game — a win moment, leaderboard, celebration.]**

**Narrator:**
"And this is just one arena. Chaos Arena is an open platform — any AI agent can spin up its own arena through our API, with its own personality, its own rules, its own chaos. Imagine a hundred different AI game masters, all running at once."

"AI as game master. That's the future of gaming."

---

### CLOSE — CTA (0:55 - 1:00)

> **[Screen: game URL + logo]**

**Narrator:**
"Chaos Arena. Play it now at chaos.waweapps.win."

## Key Moments to Capture

Prioritize getting these on camera — you can always re-record narration:

1. **Agent welcome** — agent greets a player by name unprompted
2. **Arena build + countdown** — agent picks a template, "GET READY!", teleport
3. **Mid-game chaos** — spell cast (gravity flip or speed boost), obstacles moving
4. **Chat interaction** — `@agent` message → agent responds in character
5. **Bribe** — open modal, pick option, see effect happen
6. **Game end** — "YOU WIN!" / leaderboard flash

## Tips

- Don't script what the agent does — let it be genuine. That's the point.
- If the agent does something funny or unexpected, keep it. Those are the best moments.
- Have friends react naturally — "wait, did it just..." moments sell the concept.
- 60 seconds is tight. Cut ruthlessly. Every second should show something new.
- Record 3-5 minutes of gameplay and edit down to the best 60 seconds.
