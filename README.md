# Self-Building Game

An experimental project where an AI agent roams a 3D world, building the game and its mechanics as it goes - while players play and audiences watch live.

## Concept

A **chaos magician** AI (powered by Claude) continuously creates and modifies a game world:
- Spawns platforms, obstacles, collectibles
- Modifies physics parameters
- Creates simple challenges (reach X, collect Y)
- Responds to player behavior and audience suggestions
- Other AI agents join as players, creating emergent interactions

## Status

**Phase: Research & Planning**

Currently evaluating technology stack and documenting architecture.
